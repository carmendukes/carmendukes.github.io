    <h1>Glare</h1>
    <p>
      perhaps all the ones and zeros have gone to my head&mdash;<br />
      replaced the delight in ordinary things like sweet <br />
      summer blueberries and my bare feet on dune grass
    </p>
    <p>
      this body feels like it was built for beautiful <br />
      the small: a speckled hummingbird egg<br />
      the big: a star-filled sky above a moonstoned beach
      <!--the in-between: memory-->
    </p>
    <p>
      I bite my nails thinking possibility without <br />
      a beginning or end, and when I remind myself <br />
      containers are only safe if one remembers to close the lid
      <!--a safe place: sureness of a closed thought-->
    </p>
    <p>
      I've retyped this entry twenty times<br />
      <!--Twenty-one.-->
      Over-indexing on the right words instead <br />
      of the sensation of unknowing. I get torn <br />
      between chasing sunlight and chasing perfect <br />
      <!--confused as to which one is worth it -->
    </p>
    <p>
      like me, the machine prefers perfection <br />
      from an imperfect being
      those squiggly red <br />
      lines under imperfectly perfect thoughts
      <!--yes, I will always say I meant to write it even if I regret it later-->
    </p>
    <p>
      lately, I've been noticing how the sun, when low <br />
      scatters light around coast oaks and sage scrub <br />
      flocks of pelicans sparkle as they bounce on ocean swells <br />
      suddenly every being is a silhouette outlined in gold
       <!--all made significant and insignificant at the same time-->
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>and this screen</p>
    <p>bright and blindingly white</p>
    <p>disappears right before my eyes</p>
