    <h1>Glare</h1>
    <p>
      perhaps all the ones and zeros have gone to my head&mdash;replaced the
      delight in ordinary things like sweet summer blueberries and my bare feet
      on dune grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      this body feels like it was built for beautiful things. the small: a
      speckled hummingbird egg. the big: a star-filled sky above a moonstoned
      beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bite my nails thinking possibility without a beginning, end, or scale
      and containers are only safe if one remembers to close the lid.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've typed this entry twenty times.
      <!--Twenty-one.-->
      Over-indexing on the right words instead of the sensation of unknowing. I
      get torn between chasing sunlight and chasing perfection.
      <!--confused as to which one is worth it -->
    </p>
    <p>
      funny how the machine likes perfection from an imperfect being (me). those
      squiggly red lines under the wrong word, wrong grammar, wrong thought.
      <!--yes, I meant to write it even if I regret it later-->
    </p>
    <p>
      lately, I've been noticing how the sun scatters light around coast oaks
      and sage scrub. flocks of brown pelicans sparkle and bob on ocean swells.
      every being now a silhouette outlined in gold.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>and this screen</p>
    <p>bright and blindingly white</p>
    <p>disappears right before my eyes</p>
