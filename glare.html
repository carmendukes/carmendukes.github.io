    <h1>Glare</h1>
    <p>
      perhaps all the ones and zeros have gone to my head&mdash;<br />
      replaced the delight in ordinary things like sweet <br />
      summer blueberries and my bare feet on dune grass
    </p>
    <p>
      this body feels like it was built for beautiful <br />
      the small: a speckled hummingbird egg<br />
      the big: a star-filled sky above a moonstoned beach
    </p>
    <p>
      I bite my nails thinking possibility without <br />
      a beginning or end, and when I remind myself <br />
      containers are only safe if one remembers to close the lid
    </p>
    <p>
      I've typed this entry twenty times<br />
      <!--Twenty-one.-->
      Over-indexing on the right words instead <br />
      of the sensation of unknowing. I get torn <br />
      between chasing sunlight and chasing perfection <br />
      <!--confused as to which one is worth it -->
    </p>
    <p>
      funny how the machine prefers perfection <br />
      from an imperfect being.
      <!--me-->
      those squiggly red <br />
      lines under imperfectly perfect thoughts
      <!--yes, I will always say I meant to write it even if I regret it later-->
    </p>
    <p>
      lately, I've been noticing how the sun, when low <br />
      scatters light around coast oaks and sage scrub <br />
      flocks of brown pelicans sparkle upon ocean swells <br />
      every being becomes a silhouette outlined in gold
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>and this screen</p>
    <p>bright and blindingly white</p>
    <p>disappears right before my eyes</p>
